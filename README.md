## Placely tech test

This is a NextJS app. The objective of the test is to write component(s) to render a menu.

This test is designed to be completed in 1 hour. You should not spend too much time trying to style the menu; some indicatino of how you would approach the styling is sufficient.

### Instructions

1. Clone this repository
2. Work to complete this page: [src/app/menu/page.tsx]
3. The ultimate objective is to render a menu that's returned by the mock api file: [src/app/menu/api3.ts]. If it helps, you can start with __api.ts__ and __api2.ts__ which are simpler versions of the menu.
4. __IMPORTANT__ please don't commit and push your changes straight into the __main__ branch. Instead, zip-up your work and send it to me directly. Please include instructions and notes about your solution, including how to run the app on a local environment.

### What we test for

- clean code and organisation
- your approach to styling
- some consideration for testing (if you have time)
